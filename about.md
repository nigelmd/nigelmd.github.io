Hi, I'm [Nigel D'Souza](https://www.nigeldsouza.io), an experienced software engineer, worked at Tiktok, Oracle and a digital agency.

I'm currently the founder of a stealth startup in the fintech space so keep an eye out for updates.

Aside from technology, I love scuba diving, basketball, video games, dancing, skating, drumming and all outdoor activities with my dog.
